# Ration Distribution System: Empowering Communities

## Problem Statement
In modern ration distribution systems, neglected commodities often become waste or are sold at higher prices in the market. Many consumers do not fully utilize their rationed commodities, while poor individuals suffer from food scarcity due to the inefficiencies of the system.

## Idea
This project aims to enhance transparency and efficiency in ration distribution by digitizing the process. By using QR code technology, we will streamline access to information, facilitate online donations, and reduce waste, ensuring that commodities reach those who need them most.

## Uses
**Transparent Distribution**: Digital records and QR codes improve tracking and verification of commodities.
**Efficient Access**: Beneficiaries can access real-time information about available commodities and make use of online donations.
**Waste Reduction**: Improved tracking and redistribution of neglected commodities reduce waste and prevent higher market prices.
**Donor Notifications**: SMS updates inform donors about the current status of commodities after their donation.

## Current Working Process
**QR Code Integration**: Implementing QR codes for ration cards to enhance tracking and verification.
**Backend Development**: Creating APIs for QR code generation, management, and data handling.
**Frontend Development**: Building interfaces for QR code display and scanning.
**Ongoing Enhancements**: Linking ration cards with the website and adding advanced QR scanning features.
